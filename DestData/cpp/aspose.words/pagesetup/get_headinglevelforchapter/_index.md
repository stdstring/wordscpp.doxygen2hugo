## PageSetup::get_HeadingLevelForChapter method


Gets or sets the heading level style that is applied to the chapter titles in the document.

```cpp
int32_t Aspose::Words::PageSetup::get_HeadingLevelForChapter()
```


Can be a number from 0 through 9. 0 means no chapter number if applied to page number.

Before you can create page numbers that include chapter numbers, the document headings must have a numbered outline format applied.
