auto builder = MakeObject<DocumentBuilder>(doc);

// Modify the "LinesToDrop" property to designate a paragraph as a drop cap,
// which will turn it into a large capital letter that will decorate the next paragraph.
// Give this property a value of 4 to give the drop cap the height of four text lines.
builder->get_ParagraphFormat()->set_LinesToDrop(4);
builder->Writeln(u"H");

// Reset the "LinesToDrop" property to 0 to turn the next paragraph into an ordinary paragraph.
// The text in this paragraph will wrap around the drop cap.
builder->get_ParagraphFormat()->set_LinesToDrop(0);
