Shows how to add a comment to a document, and then reply to it.

auto doc = MakeObject<Document>();
auto builder = MakeObject<DocumentBuilder>(doc);

auto comment = MakeObject<Comment>(doc, u"John Doe", u"J.D.", System::DateTime::get_Now());
comment->SetText(u"My comment.");

// Place the comment at a node in the document's body.
// This comment will show up at the location of its paragraph,
// outside the right-side margin of the page, and with a dotted line connecting it to its paragraph.
builder->get_CurrentParagraph()->AppendChild(comment);

// Add a reply, which will show up under its parent comment.
comment->AddReply(u"Joe Bloggs", u"J.B.", System::DateTime::get_Now(), u"New reply");

// Comments and replies are both Comment nodes.
ASSERT_EQ(2, doc->GetChildNodes(NodeType::Comment, true)->get_Count());

// Comments that do not reply to other comments are "top-level". They have no ancestor comments.
ASSERT_TRUE(comment->get_Ancestor() == nullptr);

// Replies have an ancestor top-level comment.
ASPOSE_ASSERT_EQ(comment, comment->get_Replies()->idx_get(0)->get_Ancestor());

doc->Save(ArtifactsDir + u"Comment.AddCommentWithReply.docx");
```
