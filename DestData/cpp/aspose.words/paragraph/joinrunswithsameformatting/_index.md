## Paragraph::JoinRunsWithSameFormatting method


Joins runs with the same formatting in the paragraph.

```cpp
int32_t Aspose::Words::Paragraph::JoinRunsWithSameFormatting()
```


### ReturnValue

Number of joins performed. When **N** adjacent runs are being joined they count as **N - 1** joins.

## Examples



Shows how to simplify paragraphs by merging superfluous runs. 
```cpp
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>();
auto builder = MakeObject<DocumentBuilder>(doc);

// Insert four runs of text into the paragraph.
builder->Write(u"Run 1. ");
builder->Write(u"Run 2. ");
builder->Write(u"Run 3. ");
builder->Write(u"Run 4. ");

// If we open this document in Microsoft Word, the paragraph will look like one seamless text body.
// However, it will consist of four separate runs with the same formatting. Fragmented paragraphs like this
// may occur when we manually edit parts of one paragraph many times in Microsoft Word.
SharedPtr<Paragraph> para = builder->get_CurrentParagraph();

ASSERT_EQ(4, para->get_Runs()->get_Count());

// Change the style of the last run to set it apart from the first three.
para->get_Runs()->idx_get(3)->get_Font()->set_StyleIdentifier(StyleIdentifier::Emphasis);

// We can run the "JoinRunsWithSameFormatting" method to optimize the document's contents
// by merging similar runs into one, reducing their overall count.
// This method also returns the number of runs that this method merged.
// These two merges occurred to combine Runs #1, #2, and #3,
// while leaving out Run #4 because it has an incompatible style.
ASSERT_EQ(2, para->JoinRunsWithSameFormatting());

// The number of runs left will equal the original count
// minus the number of run merges that the "JoinRunsWithSameFormatting" method carried out.
ASSERT_EQ(2, para->get_Runs()->get_Count());
ASSERT_EQ(u"Run 1. Run 2. Run 3. ", para->get_Runs()->idx_get(0)->get_Text());
ASSERT_EQ(u"Run 4. ", para->get_Runs()->idx_get(1)->get_Text());
```
