## Node.get_PreviousSibling method


Gets the node immediately preceding this node.

```cpp
System::SharedPtr<Aspose::Words::Node> Aspose::Words::Node::get_PreviousSibling()
```


## Examples




Shows how to use of methods of [Node](../) and [CompositeNode](../../compositenode/) to remove a section before the last section in the document. 
```cpp
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>();
auto builder = MakeObject<DocumentBuilder>(doc);

builder->Writeln(u"Section 1 text.");
builder->InsertBreak(BreakType::SectionBreakContinuous);
builder->Writeln(u"Section 2 text.");

// Both sections are siblings of each other.
auto lastSection = System::DynamicCast<Section>(doc->get_LastChild());
auto firstSection = System::DynamicCast<Section>(lastSection->get_PreviousSibling());

// Remove a section based on its sibling relationship with another section.
if (lastSection->get_PreviousSibling() != nullptr)
{
    doc->RemoveChild(firstSection);
}

// The section we removed was the first one, leaving the document with only the second.
ASSERT_EQ(u"Section 2 text.", doc->GetText().Trim());
```
