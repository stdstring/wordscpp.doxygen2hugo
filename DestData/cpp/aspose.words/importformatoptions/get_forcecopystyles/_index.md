## ImportFormatOptions::get_ForceCopyStyles method


Gets or sets a boolean value indicating either to copy conflicting styles in **KeepSourceFormatting** mode. The default value is **false**.

```cpp
bool Aspose::Words::ImportFormatOptions::get_ForceCopyStyles() const
```

## Remarks


By default, if a matching style already exists in a destination document, the source style formatting is expanded into direct node attributes and the style of this node is reset to a default.

When this option is set to **true**, the source style will be forcibly copied into destination document with unique name and applied to the imported node.

Note, in this case it is not guaranteed that formatting of the imported node in destination document will be preserved.
