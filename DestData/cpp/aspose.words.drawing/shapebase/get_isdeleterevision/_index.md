## ShapeBase::get_IsDeleteRevision method


Returns true if this object was deleted in Microsoft Word while change tracking was enabled.

```cpp
bool Aspose::Words::Drawing::ShapeBase::get_IsDeleteRevision()
```


## Examples



Shows how to work with revision shapes. 
```cpp
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>();

ASSERT_FALSE(doc->get_TrackRevisions());

// Insert an inline shape without tracking revisions, which will make this shape not a revision of any kind.
auto shape = MakeObject<Shape>(doc, ShapeType::Cube);
shape->set_WrapType(WrapType::Inline);
shape->set_Width(100.0);
shape->set_Height(100.0);
doc->get_FirstSection()->get_Body()->get_FirstParagraph()->AppendChild(shape);

// Start tracking revisions and then insert another shape, which will be a revision.
doc->StartTrackRevisions(u"John Doe");

shape = MakeObject<Shape>(doc, ShapeType::Sun);
shape->set_WrapType(WrapType::Inline);
shape->set_Width(100.0);
shape->set_Height(100.0);
doc->get_FirstSection()->get_Body()->get_FirstParagraph()->AppendChild(shape);

ArrayPtr<SharedPtr<Shape>> shapes = doc->GetChildNodes(NodeType::Shape, true)->LINQ_OfType<SharedPtr<Shape>>()->LINQ_ToArray();

ASSERT_EQ(2, shapes->get_Length());

shapes[0]->Remove();

// Since we removed that shape while we were tracking changes,
// the shape persists in the document and counts as a delete revision.
// Accepting this revision will remove the shape permanently, and rejecting it will keep it in the document.
ASSERT_EQ(ShapeType::Cube, shapes[0]->get_ShapeType());
ASSERT_TRUE(shapes[0]->get_IsDeleteRevision());

// And we inserted another shape while tracking changes, so that shape will count as an insert revision.
// Accepting this revision will assimilate this shape into the document as a non-revision,
// and rejecting the revision will remove this shape permanently.
ASSERT_EQ(ShapeType::Sun, shapes[1]->get_ShapeType());
ASSERT_TRUE(shapes[1]->get_IsInsertRevision());
```
