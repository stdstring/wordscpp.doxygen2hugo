| Center | 2 | Specifies that the object shall be centered with respect to the vertical alignment base. |
| Bottom | 3 | Specifies that the object shall be at the bottom of the vertical alignment base. |
| Inside | 4 | Specifies that the object shall be inside of the horizontal alignment base. |
| Outside | 5 | Specifies that the object shall be outside of the vertical alignment base. |
| Inline | -1 | Not documented. Seems to be a possible value for floating paragraphs and tables. |

## Examples



Shows how to insert a floating image to the center of a page. 
```cpp
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>();
auto builder = MakeObject<DocumentBuilder>(doc);

// Insert a floating image that will appear behind the overlapping text and align it to the page's center.
SharedPtr<Shape> shape = builder->InsertImage(ImageDir + u"Logo.jpg");
shape->set_WrapType(WrapType::None);
shape->set_BehindText(true);
shape->set_RelativeHorizontalPosition(RelativeHorizontalPosition::Page);
shape->set_RelativeVerticalPosition(RelativeVerticalPosition::Page);
shape->set_HorizontalAlignment(HorizontalAlignment::Center);
shape->set_VerticalAlignment(VerticalAlignment::Center);

doc->Save(ArtifactsDir + u"Image.CreateFloatingPageCenter.docx");
```
