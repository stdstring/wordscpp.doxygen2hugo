## MailMergeSettings::get_LinkToQuery method


Not sure about this one. The Microsoft Word Automation Reference suggests that this specifies that the query is executed every time the document is opened in Microsoft Word. But the OOXML specification suggests that this specifies that the query contains a reference to an external query file which contains the actual query. The default value is **false**.

```cpp
bool Aspose::Words::Settings::MailMergeSettings::get_LinkToQuery() const
```
