SharedPtr<Shape> chartShape = builder->InsertChart(ChartType::Bar, 400, 300);
SharedPtr<Chart> chart = chartShape->get_Chart();

// Use the "Title" property to give our chart a title, which appears at the top center of the chart area.
SharedPtr<ChartTitle> title = chart->get_Title();
title->set_Text(u"My Chart");

// Set the "Show" property to "true" to make the title visible.
title->set_Show(true);
