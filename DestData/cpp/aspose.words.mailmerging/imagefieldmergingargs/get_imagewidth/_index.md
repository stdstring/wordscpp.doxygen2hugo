## ImageFieldMergingArgs::get_ImageWidth method

```cpp
const System::SharedPtr<Aspose::Words::Fields::MergeFieldImageDimension> & Aspose::Words::MailMerging::ImageFieldMergingArgs::get_ImageWidth() const
```

## Remarks


The value of this property initially comes from the corresponding MERGEFIELD's code, contained in the template document. To override the initial value, you should assign an instance of [MergeFieldImageDimension](../../../aspose.words.fields/mergefieldimagedimension/) class to this property or set the properties for the instance of [MergeFieldImageDimension](../../../aspose.words.fields/mergefieldimagedimension/) class, returned by this property.

To indicate that the original value of the image width should be applied, you should assign the **null** value to this property or set the [Value](../../../aspose.words.fields/mergefieldimagedimension/get_value/) property for the instance of [MergeFieldImageDimension](../../../aspose.words.fields/mergefieldimagedimension/) class, returned by this property, to a negative value.
