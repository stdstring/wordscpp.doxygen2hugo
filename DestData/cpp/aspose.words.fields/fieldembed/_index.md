Implements the EMBED field.

```cpp
class FieldEmbed : public Aspose::Words::Fields::Field
```

## Methods

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [get_DisplayResult](../field/get_displayresult/)() | Gets the text that represents the displayed field result. |
| [get_End](../field/get_end/)() const | Gets the node that represents the field end. |
| [get_FieldEnd](../field/get_fieldend/)() const | Gets the node that represents the field end. |
| [get_FieldStart](../field/get_fieldstart/)() const | Gets the node that represents the start of the field. |
| [get_Format](../field/get_format/)() | Gets a [FieldFormat](../fieldformat/) object that provides typed access to field's formatting. |
| [get_IsDirty](../field/get_isdirty/)() | Gets or sets whether the current result of the field is no longer correct (stale) due to other modifications made to the document. |
| [get_IsLocked](../field/get_islocked/)() | Gets or sets whether the field is locked (should not recalculate its result). |
| [get_LocaleId](../field/get_localeid/)() | Gets or sets the LCID of the field. |
| [get_Result](../field/get_result/)() | Gets or sets text that is between the field separator and field end. |
| [get_Separator](../field/get_separator/)() | Gets the node that represents the field separator. Can be null. |
| [get_Start](../field/get_start/)() const | Gets the node that represents the start of the field. |
| virtual [get_Type](../field/get_type/)() const | Gets the Microsoft Word field type. |
| [GetFieldCode](../field/getfieldcode/)() | Returns text between field start and field separator (or field end if there is no separator). Both field code and field result of child fields are included. |
| [GetFieldCode](../field/getfieldcode/)(bool) | Returns text between field start and field separator (or field end if there is no separator). |
| [Remove](../field/remove/)() | Removes the field from the document. Returns a node right after the field. If the field's end is the last child of its parent node, returns its parent paragraph. If the field is already removed, returns **null**. |
| [set_IsDirty](../field/set_isdirty/)(bool) | Setter for [Aspose::Words::Fields::Field::get_IsDirty](../field/get_isdirty/). |
| [set_IsLocked](../field/set_islocked/)(bool) | Setter for [Aspose::Words::Fields::Field::get_IsLocked](../field/get_islocked/). |
| [set_LocaleId](../field/set_localeid/)(int32_t) | Setter for [Aspose::Words::Fields::Field::get_LocaleId](../field/get_localeid/). |
| [set_Result](../field/set_result/)(const System::String\&) | Setter for [Aspose::Words::Fields::Field::get_Result](../field/get_result/). |
| [Unlink](../field/unlink/)() | Performs the field unlink. |
| [Update](../field/update/)() | Performs the field update. Throws if the field is being updated already. |
| [Update](../field/update/)(bool) | Performs a field update. Throws if the field is being updated already. |

## Examples




Shows how some older Microsoft Word fields such as SHAPE and EMBED are handled during loading. 
```cpp
// Open a document that was created in Microsoft Word 2003.
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(MyDir + u"Legacy fields.doc");

// If we open the Word document and press Alt+F9, we will see a SHAPE and an EMBED field.
// A SHAPE field is the anchor/canvas for an AutoShape object with the "In line with text" wrapping style enabled.
// An EMBED field has the same function, but for an embedded object,
// such as a spreadsheet from an external Excel document.
// However, these fields will not appear in the document's Fields collection.
ASSERT_EQ(0, doc->get_Range()->get_Fields()->get_Count());

// These fields are supported only by old versions of Microsoft Word.
// The document loading process will convert these fields into Shape objects,
// which we can access in the document's node collection.
SharedPtr<NodeCollection> shapes = doc->GetChildNodes(NodeType::Shape, true);
ASSERT_EQ(3, shapes->get_Count());

// The first Shape node corresponds to the SHAPE field in the input document,
// which is the inline canvas for the AutoShape.
auto shape = System::DynamicCast<Shape>(shapes->idx_get(0));
ASSERT_EQ(ShapeType::Image, shape->get_ShapeType());

// The second Shape node is the AutoShape itself.
shape = System::DynamicCast<Shape>(shapes->idx_get(1));
ASSERT_EQ(ShapeType::Can, shape->get_ShapeType());

// The third Shape is what was the EMBED field that contained the external spreadsheet.
shape = System::DynamicCast<Shape>(shapes->idx_get(2));
ASSERT_EQ(ShapeType::OleObject, shape->get_ShapeType());
```
