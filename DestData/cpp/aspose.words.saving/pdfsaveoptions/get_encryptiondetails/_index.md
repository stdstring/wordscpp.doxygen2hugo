## PdfSaveOptions::get_EncryptionDetails method


Gets or sets the details for encrypting the output PDF document.

```cpp
System::SharedPtr<Aspose::Words::Saving::PdfEncryptionDetails> Aspose::Words::Saving::PdfSaveOptions::get_EncryptionDetails() const
```

## Remarks


The default value is null and the output document will not be encrypted. When this property is set to a valid [PdfEncryptionDetails](../../pdfencryptiondetails/) object, then the output PDF document will be encrypted.

AES-128 encryption algorithm is used when saving to PDF 1.7 based compliance (including PDF/UA-1). AES-256 encryption algorithm is used when saving to PDF 2.0 based compliance.

Encryption is prohibited by PDF/A compliance. This option will be ignored when saving to PDF/A.

**ContentCopyForAccessibility** permission is required by PDF/UA compliance if the output document is encrypted. This permission will automatically used when saving to PDF/UA.

**ContentCopyForAccessibility** permission is deprecated in PDF 2.0 format. This permission will be ignored when saving to PDF 2.0.

## Examples



Shows how to set permissions on a saved PDF document. 
```cpp
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>();
auto builder = MakeObject<DocumentBuilder>(doc);

builder->Writeln(u"Hello world!");

auto encryptionDetails = MakeObject<PdfEncryptionDetails>(u"password", String::Empty);

// Start by disallowing all permissions.
encryptionDetails->set_Permissions(PdfPermissions::DisallowAll);

// Extend permissions to allow the editing of annotations.
encryptionDetails->set_Permissions(PdfPermissions::ModifyAnnotations | PdfPermissions::DocumentAssembly);

// Create a "PdfSaveOptions" object that we can pass to the document's "Save" method
// to modify how that method converts the document to .PDF.
auto saveOptions = MakeObject<PdfSaveOptions>();

// Enable encryption via the "EncryptionDetails" property.
saveOptions->set_EncryptionDetails(encryptionDetails);

// When we open this document, we will need to provide the password before accessing its contents.
doc->Save(ArtifactsDir + u"PdfSaveOptions.EncryptionPermissions.pdf", saveOptions);
```
