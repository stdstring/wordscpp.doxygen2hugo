## PdfSaveOptions.get_JpegQuality method


Gets or sets a value determining the quality of the JPEG images inside PDF document.

```cpp
int32_t Aspose::Words::Saving::PdfSaveOptions::get_JpegQuality()
```


The default value is 100.

This property is used in conjunction with the [ImageCompression](../get_imagecompression/) option.

Has effect only when a document contains JPEG images.

Use this property to get or set the quality of the images inside a document when saving in PDF format. The value may vary from 0 to 100 where 0 means worst quality but maximum compression and 100 means best quality but minimum compression. If quality is 100 and source image is JPEG, it means no compression - original bytes will be saved.

## Examples




Shows how to specify a compression type for all images in a document that we are converting to PDF. 
```cpp
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>();
auto builder = MakeObject<DocumentBuilder>(doc);

builder->Writeln(u"Jpeg image:");
builder->InsertImage(ImageDir + u"Logo.jpg");
builder->InsertParagraph();
builder->Writeln(u"Png image:");
builder->InsertImage(ImageDir + u"Transparent background logo.png");

// Create a "PdfSaveOptions" object that we can pass to the document's "Save" method
// to modify how that method converts the document to .PDF.
auto pdfSaveOptions = MakeObject<PdfSaveOptions>();

// Set the "ImageCompression" property to "PdfImageCompression.Auto" to use the
// "ImageCompression" property to control the quality of the Jpeg images that end up in the output PDF.
// Set the "ImageCompression" property to "PdfImageCompression.Jpeg" to use the
// "ImageCompression" property to control the quality of all images that end up in the output PDF.
pdfSaveOptions->set_ImageCompression(pdfImageCompression);

// Set the "JpegQuality" property to "10" to strengthen compression at the cost of image quality.
pdfSaveOptions->set_JpegQuality(10);

doc->Save(ArtifactsDir + u"PdfSaveOptions.ImageCompression.pdf", pdfSaveOptions);
```
