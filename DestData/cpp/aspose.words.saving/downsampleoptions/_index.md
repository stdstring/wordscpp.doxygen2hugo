Allows to specify downsample options. 

## Methods

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [DownsampleOptions](./downsampleoptions/)() |  |
| [get_DownsampleImages](./get_downsampleimages/)() const | Specifies whether images should be downsampled.  |
| [get_Resolution](./get_resolution/)() const | Specifies the resolution in pixels per inch which the images should be downsampled to.  |
| [get_ResolutionThreshold](./get_resolutionthreshold/)() const | Specifies the threshold resolution in pixels per inch. If resolution of an image in the document is less than threshold value, the downsampling algorithm will not be applied. A value of 0 means the threshold check is not used and all images that can be reduced in size are downsampled.  |
| [set_DownsampleImages](./set_downsampleimages/)(bool) | Setter for Aspose::Words::Saving::DownsampleOptions::get_DownsampleImages.  |
| [set_Resolution](./set_resolution/)(int32_t) | Setter for Aspose::Words::Saving::DownsampleOptions::get_Resolution.  |
| [set_ResolutionThreshold](./set_resolutionthreshold/)(int32_t) | Setter for Aspose::Words::Saving::DownsampleOptions::get_ResolutionThreshold.  |
