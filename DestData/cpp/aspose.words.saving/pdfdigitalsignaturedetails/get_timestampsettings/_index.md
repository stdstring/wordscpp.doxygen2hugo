## PdfDigitalSignatureDetails.get_TimestampSettings method


Gets or sets the digital signature timestamp settings.

```cpp
System::SharedPtr<Aspose::Words::Saving::PdfDigitalSignatureTimestampSettings> Aspose::Words::Saving::PdfDigitalSignatureDetails::get_TimestampSettings() const
```


The default value is null and the digital signature will not be time-stamped. When this property is set to a valid [PdfDigitalSignatureTimestampSettings](../../pdfdigitalsignaturetimestampsettings/) object, then the digital signature in the PDF document will be time-stamped.
