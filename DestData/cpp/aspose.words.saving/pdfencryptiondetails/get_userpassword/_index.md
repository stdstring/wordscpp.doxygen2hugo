## PdfEncryptionDetails::get_UserPassword method


Specifies the user password required for opening the encrypted PDF document.

```cpp
System::String Aspose::Words::Saving::PdfEncryptionDetails::get_UserPassword() const
```

## Remarks


The user password will be required to open an encrypted PDF document for viewing. The permissions specified in [Permissions](../get_permissions/) will be enforced by the reader software.

The user password can be null or empty string, in this case no password will be required from the user when opening the PDF document. The user password cannot be the same as the owner password.

## Examples



Shows how to set permissions on a saved PDF document. 
```cpp
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>();
auto builder = MakeObject<DocumentBuilder>(doc);

builder->Writeln(u"Hello world!");

auto encryptionDetails = MakeObject<PdfEncryptionDetails>(u"password", String::Empty);

// Start by disallowing all permissions.
encryptionDetails->set_Permissions(PdfPermissions::DisallowAll);

// Extend permissions to allow the editing of annotations.
encryptionDetails->set_Permissions(PdfPermissions::ModifyAnnotations | PdfPermissions::DocumentAssembly);

// Create a "PdfSaveOptions" object that we can pass to the document's "Save" method
// to modify how that method converts the document to .PDF.
auto saveOptions = MakeObject<PdfSaveOptions>();

// Enable encryption via the "EncryptionDetails" property.
saveOptions->set_EncryptionDetails(encryptionDetails);

// When we open this document, we will need to provide the password before accessing its contents.
doc->Save(ArtifactsDir + u"PdfSaveOptions.EncryptionPermissions.pdf", saveOptions);
```
