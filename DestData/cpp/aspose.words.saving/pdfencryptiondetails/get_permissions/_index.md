auto encryptionDetails = MakeObject<PdfEncryptionDetails>(u"password", String::Empty);

// Start by disallowing all permissions.
encryptionDetails->set_Permissions(PdfPermissions::DisallowAll);

// Extend permissions to allow the editing of annotations.
encryptionDetails->set_Permissions(PdfPermissions::ModifyAnnotations | PdfPermissions::DocumentAssembly);

// Create a "PdfSaveOptions" object that we can pass to the document's "Save" method
// to modify how that method converts the document to .PDF.
auto saveOptions = MakeObject<PdfSaveOptions>();

// Enable encryption via the "EncryptionDetails" property.
saveOptions->set_EncryptionDetails(encryptionDetails);

doc->Save(ArtifactsDir + u"PdfSaveOptions.EncryptionPermissions.pdf", saveOptions);
