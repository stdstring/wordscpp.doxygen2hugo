## HtmlFixedSaveOptions::get_OptimizeOutput method


Flag indicates whether it is required to optimize output. If this flag is set redundant nested canvases and empty canvases are removed, also neighbor glyphs with the same formating are concatenated. Note: The accuracy of the content display may be affected if this property is set to true. Default is true.

```cpp
bool Aspose::Words::Saving::HtmlFixedSaveOptions::get_OptimizeOutput() override
```


## Examples




Shows how to simplify a document when saving it to HTML by removing various redundant objects. 
```cpp
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(MyDir + u"Rendering.docx");

auto saveOptions = MakeObject<HtmlFixedSaveOptions>();
saveOptions->set_OptimizeOutput(optimizeOutput);

doc->Save(ArtifactsDir + u"HtmlFixedSaveOptions.OptimizeGraphicsOutput.html", saveOptions);

// The size of the optimized version of the document is almost a third of the size of the unoptimized document.
ASSERT_NEAR(optimizeOutput ? 62470 : 191726,
            MakeObject<System::IO::FileInfo>(ArtifactsDir + u"HtmlFixedSaveOptions.OptimizeGraphicsOutput.html")->get_Length(), 200);
```
